Hi my name is Antonio, I born in Cuba, but I live in Miami and I have 22 years old.I love tecnologic since years old and I  always like to learn how the computer were created, At that time I start to asking this question myself.

1. How can I build a website?
2. What is a website?
3. Who gave Revolution to this tecnologic?
4. What is and operating system?
5. What is the most struggling thing when it come to soft?
6. How to development and what engineers soft have to do ?
7. What skil do I need to be a Soft engineer?

Well I anwers all those questions at the time, so I get to the conclusion that:

1.2 I start to find out that the website is made by code.Then I see and get to the point that a website is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.Ones of the best example of website is amazon.com, the wikkipedia, google.com, safary, etc.

3.All of this was thank to Bill Gate who create Microsoft with the operating system Windows. He gave a platform for app development, and open up the possibility of doing anything in your computer.

4.An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.

5.6 “Engineers should not be passive when they are assigned tickets,” Hartsock says. “They should ask questions and ensure there is time for research. Research is a tremendous opportunity to learn, and it can be as important as coding itself, saving time and introducing more elegant solutions.”

Further, Hartsock explains, “Coding is a creative process but is also highly analytical and offers different paths to an answer. Engineers can treat every sprint ticket as a new and exciting challenge to tackle.”

Even if it’s a problem you’ve seen before, it’s always worth taking the time to see if there’s a quicker or more efficient solution. Looking at older processes with a new perspective helps you to stay engaged and keep your skills sharp.

Landrum stresses the importance of being active in the tech community, both on and off the job.

“There are so many ways to expand your knowledge in the tech world,” she says. “It can be everything from listening to podcasts to contributing to a blog or working on side projects. All of these factors can help to make sure you’re really in tune with your industry.”

7.Soft skills related to intellectual curiosity include:

* Problem-solving!
*Creativity
*Critical thinking
* Innovation
*Troubleshooting
*Brainstorming
*Research

Landrum suggests going to local meetup groups, subscribing to tech newsletters, or attending a conference.

Now is when I decide to get out of my conforrzone and make my dream come true  

With that been said I considerate that Software is something that is always going to advance to the next level and for good.It is something imnovating and special that basically is part of our live now.
