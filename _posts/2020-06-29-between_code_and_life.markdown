##  Coding is more or less like life, the objective of this is to make or create something for you or the people that help understand simple and better when they navigate online, the same as life , sometimes you or I need to explain something when a customer or person don't understand we trying to explain about a new product. Somehow in life, we manage to solve our problems by ourselves, but when you don't know how to solve we ask for help to make it simple like the other day I try to carry a glass table by myself at the end I need to get help because i couldn't do it. In code, most of the time is better to work as a team, since the other person can see what error are you getting, even better you can create something with that partner that can take you to something big that you are not expecting to happen. Sometimes I hate that the anwers is in front of me and i couldnt get pass to it, then after get more into it the anwers is not that hard.
## This is just the beginning of something new, big, frustrate it, and great at the same time of my life I wonder what new thing I going to learn tomorrow, the next day ,the day after tomorrow
